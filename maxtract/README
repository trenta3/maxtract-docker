15/11/2012

============================= DESCRIPTION ==================================

A command line tool that reads a PDF and returns different formats. Tool is written in Ocaml
and uses the pdftk for decompressingg the PDF file.

A directory with a random name is created in /tmp during operation, which is
removed after completion.

============================= REQUIREMENTS ==================================

-- PDFtk which can be obtained from http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/install-pdftk/
   If under ubuntu or debian 
      apt-get install pdftk

============================= INSTALLATION ==================================

Maxtract does not require installation, as a binary has been released.

============================== USAGE ========================================

Maxtract must be run from the directory where the binaries have been extracted to.

Running
 $  ./maxtract.opt -help

Produces the following option list

usage: ./maxtract.opt [-f file] [-o file] [-tex] [-txt] [-lay] [-mat]
  -f : -f Name of input PDF file
  -o : -o Name of output file
 -tex:    Create a latex file (default)
 -lay:    Create latex for a layered PDF with latex and text layers
 -ann:    Create latex for an annotated PDF file with latex annotations
 -txt:    Create a simple text file
 -mat:    Create a text file with math in latex


=== Further explanation ========================================================

-f Is always required and takes a PDF filename which has been validated by pdftester

-o Is always required and specifies an output filename -including extension.

[-tex -lay -txt -mat] Are the choices of output options. -tex is the
default. Any combinations of output driver can be chosen, if more than one is
chosen extensions are automatically assigned.  

.tex output from -lay and -ann option needs to be pdflatexed twice to produce the desired
pdf file.

If a file cannot be processed '0' is returned to stdout.

===EXAMPLES===

./maxtract.opt -f in./maxtract.opt -f test1.pdf -o test
produces test.tex

./maxtract.opt -f in./maxtract.opt -f test1.pdf -o test -txt
produces test.txt

./maxtract.opt -f in./maxtract.opt -f test1.pdf -o test.tex -lay -txt
produces test.txt and test-lay.tex (Remember to pdflatex test_layer.tex twice)
